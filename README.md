### Notes:
Wood: Walnut, white oak
Horizontal Panels: (top, bottom, interior shelves) should have a grain direction that runs parallel with the length of the credenza. 
Vertical Panels: back panels, interior dividers, inside layer of side panels (outer layer is metal) should be vertical grain. 

Metal Rods: Brass, Nickel, Blackened Steel 
Metal Panels: Brass, Nickel, Blackened Steel as well as powder coated colors. Olive Green RAL 6003, Matte Black, Matte White

Variations: Hinged doors open (not all at once). The way they swing is a bit untraditional so I think show the two center doors open with the outer doors closed, or vice versa. Maybe can show the adjustable shelves inside? A
